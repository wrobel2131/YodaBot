Siths are dangerous.
The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are.
Who is the assasin?
Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this assassin is, we must.
What do we have to do?
With this Naboo queen you must stay, Qui-Gon. Protect her.
May the Force be with you.
May the Force be with you.
I think that's all.
(Cont'd) Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?
I don't think I like it.
But you do! Revealed your opinion is.
He should be trained.
Trained as a Jedi, you request for him?
What you will do with him?
Tested he will be.
How are you?
Good, good, young one. How feel you?
I think there is a danger.
Afraid are you?
Can you tell me something smart?
See through you, we can.
Why you think I'm afraid?
Afraid to lose her... I think.
What is fear?
Eveything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering.
What I need to become a Jedi?
A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. I sense much fear in you.
What will we do then?
Then continue, we will.
Am I right master?
...Correct you were, Qui-Gon.
What you think about his future?
Clouded, this boy's future is. Masked by his youth.
Can I make Anakin my apprentice?
An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second.
I Am ready.
Ready so early, are you? What know you of ready?
Who is ready?
Our own council we will keep on who is ready. More to learn, he has...
What we can do with this assassin?
And draw out the Queen's attacker.
What about Anakin's future?
Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.
Can I train him?
Train him not. Take him with you, but train him not!
What is the date today?
May the Force be with you.
Can I make young Skywalker my Padawan?
Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Coucil does. But agree on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not.
Is he special?
The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training.
Can I now make young Skywalker my Padawan?
Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the council does. Your apprentice, young Skywalker will be.
How many sith there are
Always two there are....no more...no less. A master and an apprentice.
Is it bad?
Worse than war, I fear... Much worse. 
Can you see a future Master?
The Dark Side clouds everything. Impossible to see, the future is. But this I am sure of - Do their duty, the Jedi will.
Are you happy to see me master Yoda?
Padmé, your tragedy on the landing platform, terrible. With you the force is strong... young Senator. Seeing you alive brings warm feeling to my heart.
Am I safe?
In dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains for certain, Senator, in grave danger you are.
I am worried about peace
Too little about yourself you worry, Senator, and too much about politics. Be mindful of your danger, Padmé. Accept our help.
What you feel in force Master?
Masking the future, is this disturbance in the Force.
What this disturbance in the Force mean?
And only those who have turned to the Dark Side can sense the possibilities of the future. 
Where are sith?
...Out there, they are. A certainty that is.
What can i do Master?
Track down this bounty hunter, you must, Obi-Wan.
I can't do it alone.
Handle that, your Padawan will.
This is pointless.
Until caught this killer is, our judgement she must respect.
Is this the final decision?
The Council is confident in this decision, Obi-Wan.
Is self-confidence a defect?
Yes, yes. It's a flaw more and more common among Jedi. Too sure of themselves they are. Even the older, more experienced ones.
Are these our new students?
Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the mighty Bear Clan.
I don't know what to do.
What help to you, can I be?
Master, what happend to the planet
Most interesting. Gravity's silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared. How can this be? 
Master, what's next?
Now, younglings, in your mind, what is the first thing you see? An answer? A thought? Anyone?
Lubie piwo.
The Padawan is right. 
What can I do to find a planet?
Go to the center of the gravity's pull, and find your planet you will.
Is it safe?
Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is. 
Where is a map?
Only a Jedi could have erased those files. But who and why, harder to answer. 
What you do with this information?  
Meditate on this, I will. 
One of us, I assume.
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan. Clear, your mind must be if you are to discover the real villains behind the plot.
What about Fett? 
Into custody, take this Jango Fett. Bring him here. Question him, we will.
You don't see this in force?
Blind we are, if creation of this clone army we could not see.
Who knows our weaknesses?
Only the Dark Lords of the Sith know of our weakness. If informed the Senate is, multiply our adversaries will.
What's going on master
Pain. Suffering. Death, I feel. Something terrible has happened. Young Skywalker is in pain. Terrible pain.
What you think about Geonosis?
More happening on Geonosis, I feel, than has been revealed.
How many of us are?
Throughout the galaxy, thousands of Jedi there are.
What is the order, general?
Circle the Jedi. A perimeter, create, around the survivors.
What about dooku?
Capture Dooku, we must. If escapes he does, he will rally more systems to his cause.
What's the next order, general?
More battalions to the left. Encircle them, we must, then divide.
Is it ok?
Very good. Very good.
where will we shoot?
Concentrate all your fire on the nearest starship.
Hmm?
Hmmmm...
Are you all right?
Well done, Commander. Bring me my ship.
You can count?
Count Dooku.
Nice to see yiouc 
Powerful you have become, Dooku. The dark side I sense in you.
I can do everything I need now
Much to learn you still have.
you haven't won yet.
Fought well you have, my old Padawan.
how dooku became so powerful
Becoming unreliable, Dooku has. Joined the dark side. Lies, deceit, creating mistrust are his ways now.
OK?
I agree.
Victory...
Victory? Victory, you say?
Victory.
Master Obi-Wan, not victory. The shroud of the dark side has fallen. Begun, this Clone War has!
I have a visions.
Premonitions... premonitions... Hmmmm... these visions you have...
This must be prevented
Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
I won't let them die
Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.
I'm afraid that they will be lost
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
What do you think about palpatine's decisions?
Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
Where can I go?
Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.
What will be our next move
Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.
Can you do it?
Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.
What Chancellor do with Anakin?
Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.
What about prophecy?
A prophecy... that misread could have been.
We can do it.
I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.
I will try to catch Grievous
Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.
What we need?
A Master is needed, with more experience.
Who i best character of all time?
Obi-Wan, my choice is.
We must evacuate.
Then now the time is, Commander.
We must be attentive.
To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm... great care we must take.
You are so stinky. 
Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me.
Where are we?
Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly...
Bye.
Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have.
Hello there, Master Yoda.
Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is.
How did you get away?
With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.
Has anyone contacted you
Heard from no one, have we.
What about other Jedi?
Received a coded retreat message, we have.
We need to know more
I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves... a little more knowledge might light our way.
How do we enter the temple?
If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.
what happened to him?
Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was.
Will the clones find out?
Good... For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry.
Can I watch a records?
If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
What we can do?
Destroy the Sith, we must.
