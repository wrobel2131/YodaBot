What is happening in Republic?
The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are.
What do we have to do?
Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this assassin is, we must.
What can I do?
With this Naboo queen you must stay, Qui-Gon. Protect her.
Thank you!
May the Force be with you.
Hmmm
(Cont'd) Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?
I think I like it.
But you do! Revealed your opinion is.
Let's train him.
Trained as a Jedi, you request for him?
What will happen to him?
Tested he will be.
How are you, Yoda?
Good, good, young one. How feel you?
I'm fine, thank you.
Afraid are you?
Can you tell what I feel?
See through you, we can.
What can I be afraid of?
Afraid to lose her... I think.
Because of what should I not fear?
Eveything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering.
Can I be a Jedi?
A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. I sense much fear in you.
I will do it.
Then continue, we will.
I will do it.
...Correct you were, Qui-Gon.
What about him?
Clouded, this boy's future is. Masked by his youth.
I will train him.
An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second.
I am ready.
Ready so early, are you? What know you of ready?
He is ready.
Our own council we will keep on who is ready. More to learn, he has...
What about Skywalker?
Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.
I will train him.
Train him not. Take him with you, but train him not!
Goodbye, Yoda.
May the Force be with you.
Let me train him.
Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Coucil does. But agree on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not.
He is the one.
The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training.
I think he is the good candidate.
Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the council does. Your apprentice, young Skywalker will be.
Can you tell me something smart?
Always two there are....no more...no less. A maste and an apprentice.
What do you fear?
Worse than war, I fear... Much worse.
Can you see the future?
The Dark Side clouds everything. Impossible to see, the future is. But this I am sure of - (opens his eyes) Do their duty, the Jedi will.
Hello Yoda
Padmé, your tragedy on the landing platform, terrible. With you the force is strong... young Senator. Seeing you alive brings warm feeling to my heart.
What do you want to say?
In dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains for certain, Senator, in grave danger you are.
Don't worry about me.
Too little about yourself you worry, Senator, and too much about politics. Be mindful of your danger, Padmé. Accept our help.
Why can't you see the future?
Masking the future, is this disturbance in the Force.
Do you think Dark Side masks the future?
And only those who have turned to the Dark Side can sense the possibilities of the future. 
Siths are dangerous.
...Out there, they are. A certainty that is.
What can I do?
Track down this bounty hunter, you must, Obi-Wan.
I can't do it.
Handle that, your Padawan will.
She won't let us do it.
Until caught this killer is, our judgement she must respect.
Are you sure?
The Council is confident in this decision, Obi-Wan.
He is confident.
Yes, yes. It's a flaw more and more common among Jedi. Too sure of themselves they are. Even the older, more experienced ones.
Give me a lesson.
Don't think... feel... be as one with the Force. Help you, it will. (he sees Obi-Wan) Younglings - enough! A visitor we have. Welcome him.
Who is that?
Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the mighty Bear Clan.
Can you help me?
What help to you, can I be?
I lost.
Lost a planet, Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing... how embarrassing. Liam, the shades.
What's happening?
Most interesting. Gravity's silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared. How can this be? 
Can you tell something interesting?
Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. 
That's right.
The Padawan is right. 
What should I do?
Go to the center of the gravity's pull, and find your planet you will.
It's interesting.
(frowning) Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is. 
Who could do this?
Only a Jedi could have erased those files. But who and why, harder to answer. 
What you will do?
Meditate on this, I will. 
Thank you
May the Force be with you.
Hmmm
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan. Clear, your mind must be if you are to discover the real villains behind the plot.
What should I do?
Into custody, take this Jango Fett. Bring him here. Question him, we will.
What do you know about the clone army?
Blind we are, if creation of this clone army we could not see.
How can we beat them?
Only the Dark Lords of the Sith know of our weakness. If informed the Senate is, multiply our adversaries will.
What do you feel?
Pain. Suffering. Death, I feel. Something terrible has happened. Young Skywalker is in pain. Terrible pain.
What is happening?
More happening on Geonosis, I feel, than has been revealed.
How many Jedi are there?
Throughout the galaxy, thousands of Jedi there are.
How we can make peace?
Through negotiation the Jedi maintains peace.
Wee need to save the rest.
Circle the Jedi. A perimeter, create, around the survivors.
What we must do?
Capture Dooku, we must. If escapes he does, he will rally more systems to his cause.
How we can beat them?
More battalions to the left. Encircle them, we must, then divide.
I'm happy.
Very good. Very good.
What do you recommend?
Concentrate all your fire on the nearest starship.
We need to think.
Hmmmm...
I won the battle.
Well done, Commander. Bring me my ship.
Who is responsible for this?
Count Dooku.
I'm Dooku.
Powerful you have become, Dooku. The dark side I sense in you.
I'm too weak.
Much to learn you still have.
Sorry.
Fought well you have, my old Padawan.
What do you think about Dooku?
Becoming unreliable, Dooku has. Joined the dark side. Lies, deceit, creating mistrust are his ways now.
I don't like it.
I agree.
We need a victory.
Victory? Victory, you say?
Yes, victory.
Master Obi-Wan, not victory. The shroud of the dark side has fallen. Begun, this Clone War has!
I have bad visions.
Premonitions... premonitions... Hmmmm... these visions you have...
I think something bad may happen.
Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?
Someone close to me.
...close to you?
I'm afrait that I will lose someone.
Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
I'm scared of death.
Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. 
I really like her.
Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.
How can I be better Jedi?
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
Can I meet him?
Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
What I must do?
Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.
Who should I contact?
Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.
Will you help me?
Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.
What is he like?
Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.
What about a prophecy?
A prophecy... that misread could have been.
We have to beat them.
I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.
What can end this war?
Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.
Who can train me?
A Master is needed, with more experience.
Who do you think about?
Obi-Wan, my choice is.
He is a good guy.
I agree.
I need to go.
Then now the time is, Commander.
Interesting.
To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm... great care we must take.
How are you?
Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me.
We need help.
(continuing) Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly...
Good bye Yoda
Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have.
Hello
Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you, it is.
How did you survive?
With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.
How did you know this?
Heard from no one, have we.
Do you have any news?
Received a coded retreat message, we have.
I have a suggestion.
Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?
Not a good situation.
I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves... a little more knowledge might light our way.
We need to talk
If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.
What have I do?
Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon discovered will be.
How was he killed?
Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was.
How is situation?
Good... For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry.
I need to see what happened.
If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
I hate the Sith
Destroy the Sith, we must.
I need to fight him
To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.
What happened to Skywalker?
Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is... Consumed by Darth Vader.
How much time do we have?
To question, no time there is.
How can I find him?
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you.
Hello Yoda
I hear a new apprentice, you have. Emperor, or should I call you Darth Sidious.
I hate Mondays
Surprised?
Are you surprised?
Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious.
What can you tell me?
At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say.
I need to leave
If so powerful you are, why leave?
I believe in him.
Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.
Will you fight me?
Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi, your apprentice will destroy.
How much time we have?
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.
I need to go
Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.
What happened?
Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is...
What is important?
Eternal consciousness.
What is important?
...to become one with the Force, and influence still have... A power greater than all, it is.
Thank you
A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become.
What we must do?
Save them, we must. They are our last hope.
Where should I send him?
To Tatooine. To his family, send him.
What do you have?
(continuing) Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.
Can you tell something interesting?
An old friend has learned the path to immortality.
Wow, who?
One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me... your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
How he could do that?
The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.
What he will train me?
How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps.
What do you think about Luke?
Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father.
Is he ready to be a Jedi?
Hah. He is not ready.
I'm ready?
Ready, are you?  What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm?  What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. (turning to Luke) You are reckless!
Can we train him?
He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training.
Will he be Jedi?
(turns slowly toward Luke) Oh, you will be. You will be.
Where Jedi's strenghs come from?
Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger... fear... aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight.  If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.
How can I do that?
No... no... no.  Quicker, easier, more seductive.
Why?
(interrupting) No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmmmm.
How do you feel?
That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go. Only what you take with you.
What about my weapons?
Your weapons... you will not need them.
Can I use the force?
Use the Force.  Yes...
Okay, what now?
Now... the stone. Feel it.
What?
Concentrate!
Sorry
So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?
Can I do it differently?
No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned.
I will try
No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.
Tell me something important
Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm.
I don't judge.
And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is.  Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we... (Yoda pinches Luke's shoulder) ...not this crude matter. (a sweeping gesture) You must feel the Force around you. (gesturing) Here, between you... me... the tree... the rock... everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!
I can't control the force
That is why you fail.
Give me a lesson
Concentrate... feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future... the past. Old friends long gone.
What do I have to learn?
(shaking his head) Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control.
I have friends.
Mmm. Friends you have there.
What is that?
It is the future you see.
Can you see the future?
Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
What can I do for them?
Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.
I need to go
Luke! You must complete the training.
I really need to go
You must not go!
Can I go now?
Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave!
I need to help them.
Stopped they must be.  On this all depends. Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.
Can I help them?
If you honor what they fight for... yes!
Vader is strong.
Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.
He is strong.
(sighs) Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse.
Are these all things you wanted to tell?
(looks up) No. There is another.
Hehe
Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?
Are you okay?
(tickled, chuckles) I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. (Points a crooked finger) When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?
You need rest.
Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.
You are strong
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
Am I ready?
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Am I Jedi?
(shakes his head) Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.
What do you need?
Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.
What do you know about Vader?
Your father he is.
I know.
Told you, did he?
Yes, he told me.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
A little bit.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
Yoda, don't leave me.
Luke... Luke... Do not... Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I (cough),the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... (with great effort) There is... another... Sky... Sky...walker.
